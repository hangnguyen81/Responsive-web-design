Responsive Web Design with pure html5 and css

In this project, I designed some responsive web page with pure HTML5 and CSS. The web layouts were mostly designed by CSS flexbox and grid. 
Here are the list of pages I did in this project. I also got a certificate of completion of Responsive Web Design from freeCodeCamp: [View the certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/hangnguyen81/responsive-web-design)
