Responsive Web Design with pure html5 and css

In this project, I designed some responsive web page with pure HTML5 and CSS. The web layouts were mostly designed by CSS flexbox. I am planning to use CSS Grid also.
Here is the list of page I did in this project

1. The tribute page for Yersin. Source code is [here](https://github.com/hangnguyen81/Responsive-web-design/blob/main/yersin-tribute-page.html). View [page in Codepen](https://codepen.io/hangnguyen81/full/JjNjzVW)
