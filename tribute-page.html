      <h3>Biography of Alexandre Yersin </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>September 22, 1863</strong> <br />Born in Lavaux, in the Vaud canton of Switzerland
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1885 - 1886</strong> <br />
          Yersin arrived in France where he continued his studies at Hôtel-Dieu de Paris hospital. There, he joined the Institut Pasteur and was involved in vaccination sessions. He discovered the diphtheria toxin with Émile Roux in 1886.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1890 - 1894</strong><br />
          He became a ship's doctor for the Messageries Maritimes shipping company. He led three expeditions across the Annam hinterland.
        </li>
        <li>
          June 5, 1894<br />
          He was sent on a mission and reached Hong Kong. The plague had already caused 100,000 deaths in Canton that year.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>June 20, 1894</strong><br />
          He isolated the plague bacillus Yersinia pestis, which bears his name.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>From 1894 onwards </strong><br />
          He founded the Institut Pasteur in Nha Trang in 1895. He studied cattle breeding (to produce anti-plague serum) and growth of the Hevea brasiliensis, or the rubber tree. He acclimatized the cinchona tree, which enabled Indochina to meet its quinine needs during the Second World War. Alexandre Yersin was fascinated by everything – bacteriology, agronomy and astrology. He was the first person to own a car in Hanoi.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>February 27, 1943</strong><br />
          He died in Nha Trang, even though he had just started learning Greek and Latin again.
        </li>
